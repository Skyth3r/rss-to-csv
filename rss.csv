I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how an engineer has his Amazon account suspended due to a delivery driver&rsquo;s false claim.
That really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. I‚Äôve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon.,,https://akashgoswami.com/articles/removing-drm-from-kindle-books/,(https://akashgoswami.com/articles/removing-drm-from-kindle-books/),,,Mon, 21 Aug 2023 17:00:00 +0000,,(),https://akashgoswami.com/articles/removing-drm-from-kindle-books/,,(),(),,,(),()),(Sabbatical Leave (part 1),I took 9 weeks off work. Of those 9 weeks, I spent 8 travelling. This is a summary of how I found my time off and what I did, things I learnt from my first long-term travel trip and my favourite highlights.
What is sabbatical leave? A quick 101 - sabbatical leave is an extended period of time away from work. Common reasons for taking sabbatical leave are to pursue interests outside of work; such as travelling, studying, volunteering or even just to take a break to just rest.,,https://akashgoswami.com/articles/sabbatical-leave-part-1/,(https://akashgoswami.com/articles/sabbatical-leave-part-1/),,,Mon, 17 Jul 2023 08:30:00 +0000,,(),https://akashgoswami.com/articles/sabbatical-leave-part-1/,,(),(),,,(),()),(Customising my Hugo Theme,My Hugo website uses the Digital Garden Hugo theme but I&rsquo;ve made a few changes in addition to using the theme. I&rsquo;ve listed these changes below both for myself to refer back to and for anyone else that might find these useful to include in their own Hugo website üëáüèΩ
Updating lastmod text One of the first changes I made was to change the lastmod front matter text that was displayed on the theme.,,https://akashgoswami.com/articles/customising-my-hugo-theme/,(https://akashgoswami.com/articles/customising-my-hugo-theme/),,,Mon, 30 Jan 2023 21:45:00 +0000,,(),https://akashgoswami.com/articles/customising-my-hugo-theme/,,(),(),,,(),()),(Building websites with Hugo,Please note
Due to issues with the theme, I&rsquo;ve had to remove the code blocks from this article. The code is still present below but it&rsquo;s not formatted as a code block. I&rsquo;ll update this once this issue is fixed.
In the last few months, there has been a flurry of activity around personal blogs and owning your own data, since Musk took the reins of Twitter.
With that, a lot of people have been wondering how they can start their own websites.,,https://akashgoswami.com/articles/building-websites-with-hugo/,(https://akashgoswami.com/articles/building-websites-with-hugo/),,,Fri, 20 Jan 2023 08:00:00 +0000,,(),https://akashgoswami.com/articles/building-websites-with-hugo/,,(),(),,,(),()),(Why you need a personal website,Time and time again, we are shown that we cannot rely on third-party platforms to host our content.
The internet is constantly changing and with that, the platforms that host our content are constantly in flux. Platforms can fall just as quickly as they can rise, either by just going completely offline or by making drastic changes to how people interact with content on their site/platform.
There are countless examples of this happening in the past and more recently the 2022 Twitter meltdown has led to some massive changes.,,https://akashgoswami.com/articles/why-you-need-a-personal-website/,(https://akashgoswami.com/articles/why-you-need-a-personal-website/),,,Sun, 01 Jan 2023 09:00:00 +0000,,(),https://akashgoswami.com/articles/why-you-need-a-personal-website/,,(),(),,,(),())",rss,2.0

Their account has logged in on a new device Their password has been changed An export of their data was started These examples are things you should probably be notified about. But, if you go overboard with these warnings, you might find phishers triggering them intentionally.

Now, in theory, I know there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this. The number was chosen randomly and it being &ldquo;special&rdquo; is purely in my head.
In fact, if 000 were excluded from the picking process, there&rsquo;d be fewer possible CVCs and so overall they&rsquo;d be less secure.
But, 000 still feels really wrong as a CVC. Was it a bug?

It involves abusing insecure file/folder permissions to replace legitimately installed, misconfigured LaunchDaemons with malicious code.
I first spotted this issue affecting the OSQuery installer but went looking and found multiple other products with the same problem. This isn&rsquo;t a novel technique (it&rsquo;s briefly mentioned in T1543.004) but I was surprised to find it so rarely talked about.

One example doing the rounds at the moment is a bunch of Royal Mail phishing sites which all contain the string css_4WjozGK8ccMNs2W9MfwvMVZNPzpmiyysOUq4_0NulQo.
These sorts of long, random strings are extremely good indicators for tracking phishing sites.

A/B testing is a lifesaver for a solo SaaS developer. While it&rsquo;s hard to predict whether a 14-day or 1-month trial is going to get a better signup rate, it&rsquo;s really simple to test: show half of people the 14-day button and the other half the 1-month button and just measure the click-through rate.
There are loads of tools out there to help you do this, but rule #1 of running a micro-SaaS like QueryCal is to keep your technology stack simple&mdash;it&rsquo;s better to focus your time on features, not integrating a bunch of different technologies.,,https://bradleyjkemp.dev/post/simple-a/b-testing-with-caddy-and-plausible-analytics/,(https://bradleyjkemp.dev/post/simple-a/b-testing-with-caddy-and-plausible-analytics/),,,Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000,,(),https://bradleyjkemp.dev/post/simple-a/b-testing-with-caddy-and-plausible-analytics/,,(),(),,,(),()),(Assurance alerts: when measuring false-positive rate can be misleading,Nobody likes alerts that feel like a waste of time to review.

The go-to metric to use is false-positive rate&mdash;if an alert has high a false-positive rate then it&rsquo;s &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; and might be getting rid of.

Whether it&rsquo;s making them carry a hardware security key or just enforcing a short screensaver timeout, changing how people go about their work is annoying&mdash;and an annoyed user is not a secure user.
The effectiveness of a lot of security controls relies on the user cooperating. If they get frustrated with all the barriers and friction between them and doing their actual job, they might just find ways around the controls&mdash;their shortened screensaver timeout is soon &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; with a keep-awake app and now they&rsquo;re less secure than they were before.,,https://bradleyjkemp.dev/post/spending-your-security-goodwill-budget-wisely/,(https://bradleyjkemp.dev/post/spending-your-security-goodwill-budget-wisely/),,,Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000,,(),https://bradleyjkemp.dev/post/spending-your-security-goodwill-budget-wisely/,,(),(),,,(),()),(How intrusion detection honeypots work so well,Intrusion detection honeypots are just plain cool. They&rsquo;re incredibly simple to run and give you extremely accurate alerts about intruders in your systems.
A honeypot can be as simple as a fake server inside your network that alerts if anyone connects to it. There&rsquo;s no reason to intentionally connect to this bogus server, so any attempts are probably an attacker already inside your network.

You simply take some example inputs and then snapshot the resulting outputs. From then on, you can have a high degree of confidence that any changes you make have not affected backwards compatibility (as this would have been detected as a change in a snapshot).
